Hi! I am a postdoctoral scholar at [STEPP Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/stepplab/) (PI: Dr. Cara Stepp) at Boston University. My research interests include the interplay between speech perception and speech production, with the goal of understanding the cognitive and motor mechanisms that support fluent speech communication.

Before coming to Boston University, I worked at [SoundBrainLab](https://soundbrainlab.northwestern.edu/) (PI: Dr. Bharath Chandrasekaran), studying hwo the human brain represents and processes speech sounds. I received my PhD through Harvard SHBT (Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology) program under the mentorship of [Dr. Tyler Perrachione](https://sites.bu.edu/cnrlab/).
