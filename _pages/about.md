Hi! I am a postdoctoral scholar at [SoundBrain Lab](https://soundbrainlab.northwestern.edu/) (PI: Dr. Bharath Chandraseakaran) at Northwestern University. I use a combination of behavioral, computational and neuroimaging methods to study how the human brain represents and processes speech sounds, and how the speech perception system is intertwined with our general cognitive abilities.

Before coming to Northwestern University, I received my PhD through Harvard SHBT (Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology) program under the mentorship of [Dr. Tyler Perrachione](https://sites.bu.edu/cnrlab/).
